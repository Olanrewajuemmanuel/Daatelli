                            <p className="my-3">Here at Daatelli, we are all about giving academic authors a platform to present their work and get connected to other experts in their field as easy as it is to find a long-lost cousin on Facebook.</p>
                            <p className="my-3">We recognise two "issues" with the academia sharing space:</p>
                            <ul className="my-3">
                                <li>
                                    - Authors want to share their research after a long time of researching and have credit for their work
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - Researchers want to read (just the abstract and the results ðŸ˜œ) and build on the work of others
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p className="my-3">Our mission is simple: to create a platform where both authors and researchers get the best of both worlds, without the hassle of gatekeeping, convoluted processes, or endless paywalls.</p>
                            <p className="my-3">Did I also mention that you have access to powerful ML analytics to help you gain insights from your research and that of others?</p>
                            <div>
                                <h2 className="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold">The work</h2>
                                <span className="divider italic">The Foundation</span>
                                <p className="my-3">1. First things first, our early focus will be on building an intuitive and easy-to-use platform for authors to upload their work and researchers to read and engage with them.</p>
                                <p className="my-3">2. We recognise that recognition is everyting in the research space, so we are creating a system that tracks citations and rewards you with those sweet, sweet citation points.</p>
                                <p className="my-3">3. Daatelli takes copyright issues seriously, so we are building a system that ensures all works are verified and protected, and authors have full control on the visibility and distribution of their work on the platform.</p>
                                <p className="my-3">4. Browsing research should be easy. Search by keyword, author, institution, or even upload date. In fact, search for a citation of a work in a work.</p>
                                <span className="divider italic">The Community</span>
                                <p className="my-3">1. We love the intellectual camaraderie. We are building a system that supports collaborative spaces to brainstorm and build.</p>
                                <p className="my-3">2. Get connected to top researchers in your field and build meaningful relationships.</p>
                                <p className="my-3">3. You need help on your next big research proposal? Whether you are looking to connect to a circle of experts, a co-author, or a financial backer, we are creating a system where you can announce your project and ask for the support you need. Think of this as ermm...an academic crowdsourcing</p>
                                <span className="divider italic">Insights</span>
                                <p className="my-3">Understanding the past to inform the future is key to meaningful research. That's why we're creating tools that allow researchers to analyze trends in their field and extract insights from past studies. Whether you're preparing for your next field study or designing a new experiment, these tools will provide valuable data-driven recommendationsâ€”highlighting what's been done, what's trending, and where there are gaps in the research. It's like having a research assistant with a superpower for sorting through academic history, helping you refine your approach and focus on the areas most likely to yield impactful results!</p>
                                <span className="divider italic">Scaling up</span>
                                <p className="my-3">1. Real-time seamless live collaborations between researchers across borders</p>
                                <p className="my-3">2. Customising the platform to your needs by leveraging Daatelli powerful API and tools.</p>
                                <p className="my-3">3. Peer review systems</p>
